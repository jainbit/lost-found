Lost and Found Reporting System - Project Overview

The Lost and Found Reporting System is a web-based application designed to help users report lost items and locate found items through a centralized platform. Users can submit detailed reports of lost items, including specifications like color, size, and a description, while administrators can post found items that are handed in by the public.

The system uses a matching algorithm to compare lost and found items based on their characteristics and keywords, providing users with possible matches. Once a match is found, the user can contact the authorities where the item was found, based on the location details provided. The platform aims to streamline the process of recovering lost belongings by connecting individuals and administrators efficiently.
